<h1 align = center> Spooky Theme Park</h1>

<p align=justify>This project was about designing a colorful animated version of a Spooky Theme Park. In this project, we created a lively world using rides and games such as a Ferris wheel, Carousel, Frog Hopper, and Train. There were day and night transitions in the project. During the daytime, some humans appeared and enjoyed the rides. However, at night, ghosts appeared in the park, possessing the power to turn on the rides.</p>
<p align=justify>A river was situated behind the park, where ships and boats could be seen during the daytime. At night, the ghosts destroyed the boats. Additionally, there was a lighthouse beside the lake to guide ships and boats through hazardous areas. From the park, visitors could also enjoy the view of lakeside buildings.</p>
<p align=justify>For this project, we used GLUT for graphics rendering, OpenGL, and C++ as the programming language. We used Code::Blocks as the development environment for this project.</p>
